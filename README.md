Projects get dropped here for storage. Many were created in Jupyter Notebooks originally with linked files (i.e., images, datasets, training sets/models, etc.) that are not stored here, so don't be alarmed if you see errors show up in the source code.

This repository is only my "at home" or "learning" work. 

## __**It does not contain any of my FOUO or Classified work.**__
###### (That's the majority of my work...and that code is much prettier.)
